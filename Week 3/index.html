    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Computer Science & B.I.T</h1>
    <p style="color: crimson; font-size: 20px;">
      Computer science and information technology (IT) are two distinct subjects, despite their many similarities. Generally, computer science refers to designing and building computers and computer programs. Information technology, on the other hand, refers to maintaining and troubleshooting those computers and their networks, systems, and databases to ensure they run smoothly.
So while working in a computer science-based job might mean you’ll create software, design websites, or gather information on visitors to a website, a career in IT can mean you’ll make sure computers are functional and secure.
The line between IT and computer science is often blurry. Sometimes working in IT will require knowledge of computer science principles, and being a programmer will mean carrying out tasks that are considered more IT-related. And sometimes jobs that are computer-science heavy, like web development or software engineering, are referred to as IT work. All of this can lead to very understandable confusion

    <h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
    <!-- Taught by Osman-->
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      Web design and development is an umbrella term that describes the process of creating a website. Like the name suggests, it involves two major skill sets: web design and web development. Web design determines the look and feel of a website, while web development determines how it functions.
Because there isn’t always a hard line that separates the two roles, the titles are often used interchangeably. As the web continues to evolve, so do the roles.
In the almost 30 years since the first website was created, numerous job titles have emerged to describe various skill sets used to create a website, with more coming out every year. These titles often overlap, and their meanings change from company to company. It’s enough to make your head spin.

    <h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
    <!-- Taught by Mr. Koroma-->
    <p style="font-size : 20px;">
      What is statistical analysis? It’s the science of collecting, exploring and presenting large amounts of data to discover underlying patterns and trends. Statistics are applied every day – in research, industry and government – to become more scientific about decisions that need to be made. For example:
      •	Manufacturers use statistics to weave quality into beautiful fabrics, to bring lift to the airline industry and to help guitarists make beautiful music.
      •	Researchers keep children healthy by using statistics to analyze data from the production of viral vaccines, which ensures consistency and safety.
      •	Communication companies use statistics to optimize network resources, improve service and reduce customer churn by gaining greater insight into subscriber requirements.
      •	Government agencies around the world rely on statistics for a clear understanding of their countries, their businesses and their people.
      Look around you. From the tube of toothpaste in your bathroom to the planes flying overhead, you see hundreds of products and processes every day that have been improved through the use of statistics.

    <h3>Enterpreneurship</h3>
    <!-- Taught by Osman-->
    <p style="font-size : 20px;">
      entrepreneurship involves an entrepreneur who takes action to make a change in the world. Whether startup entrepreneurs solve a problem that many struggle with each day, bring people together in a way no one has before, or build something revolutionary that advances society, they all have one thing in common: action.

It’s not some idea that’s stuck in your head. Entrepreneurs take the idea and execute it. Entrepreneurship is about execution of ideas.

    <h3>Programming Practices</h3>
